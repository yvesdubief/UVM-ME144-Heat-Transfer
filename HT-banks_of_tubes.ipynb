Cylinder banks are common heat exchangers where the cylinders may be heated by electricity or a fluid may be flowing within the cylinder to cool or heat the flow around the cylinders. The advantage of cylinder banks is the increase mixing in the fluid, thus the temperature downstream of the bank is likely to be quite homogeneous.\n",
