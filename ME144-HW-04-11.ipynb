    "## Problem 1\n",
    "A thermos bottle has an inner diameter of $7\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ is $10\\;\\mathrm{cm}$ tall. The wall is composed of a sealed air chamber of thickness $1\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ sandwiched between two thin cylinders of stainless steal, $k_{stst}=15\\;\\mathrm{W/(m.K)}$, of thickness $2\\;\\mathrm{mm}$. The goal is to hold tea as close as possible to its ideal temperature of $80\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ for an hour in some of the weather we have had recently. For an ambient air at $T_\\infty=-20\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ and a wind of $10\\;\\mathrm{m/s}$, the convection coefficient around the bottle is $h = 28.7\\times10^3\\;\\mathrm{W/(m^2.K)}$. The radiation heat transfer is assumed to be negligible. All heat transfer calculations are assumed to be 1D.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1.) Calculate the heat rate of the system if the air chamber is at atmospheric pressure  $k_{air}=0.022\\;\\mathrm{W/(m.K)}$\n",
    "* 2.) Typical thermos bottles are designed with the air chamber vacuumed at about $10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{torr}$ resulting in a thermal conductivity of $3\\times10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{W/m.K}$. Calculate the new heat rate.\n",
    "* 3.) Describe briefly the microscopic phenomenon that causes vacuum air to reduce so significantly the heat rate.\n",
    "* 4.) Assuming that there is no heat loss from the bottom or the lid, give an estimate of the temperature loss of the tea per second in the vacuumed and non-vacuumed scenario. To do this you only need to apply the guiding principle of heat transfer (see equation sheet) and  remember that thermal energy is $\\rho C_p T$, where the tea density is $1000\\;\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$ and $C_p= 4198.\\;\\mathrm{J/(kg.K)}$\n",
    "* 5.) Compute the heat loss from a lid made of $3 \\;\\mathrm{mm}$ of plastic with a conductivity of $5\\;\\mathrm{W/(m.K)}$. What is your conclusion regarding the ability of this thermos to hold your tea warm? If you can assume that heat loss rate is constant, how long would it take for your tea to be cold (decide what is cold based on your preference)?"

    "The key to a happy skier is to maintain the surface temperature of your skin larger than $20^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. The objective is to determine the heat flux generated by a thin electrical heater (resistance) inserted on the top of the liner, i.e. between the liner and the sock. All calculations will assume 1D planar heat transfer and to be performed per unit surface area. The study is also limited to the heat transfer from the top of the foot only. The body is assumed to be at constant temperature $36^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, or $309^\\circ\\mathrm{K}$, which is the inner boundary condition for a skin/fat layer of thickness $3\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ and $k_{skin}=3\\times10^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{W/(m.K)}$. The skin is covered by a sock of thickness $2.5\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ and $k_{sock}=7.5\\;\\mathrm{W/(m.K)}$. The liner of the boot is made of polymer fibers, thickness $5\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ and $k_\\text{liner}=6\\;\\mathrm{W/(m.K)}$ and the shell is carbon fiber, thickness $3\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ and $k_\\text{shell}=10\\;\\mathrm{W/(m.K)}$ with emissivity $\\varepsilon=0.9$.
